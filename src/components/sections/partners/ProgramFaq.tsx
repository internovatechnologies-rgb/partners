    title: "How and when do I get paid?",
    description:
      "Monthly, on collected revenue — you earn as your referred facility actually pays. If a client signs an annual plan upfront, you can take your full first-year commission as a single lump sum.",
  },
  {
    title: "What counts as a referral?",
    description:
      "A facility you introduce — that we weren’t already in conversation with — which becomes a paying customer. A warm email introduction is enough to start the clock.",
  },
  {
    title: "How long is a referral protected?",
    description:
      "For 90 days from your introduction. If the facility signs within that window, the commission is yours — even if the deal takes a few weeks to close.",
  },
  {
    title: "Do I have to sell or run demos?",
    description:
      "No. We handle every demo, onboarding, training setup, and support conversation. You make the introduction; we do the work.",
  },
  {
    title: "What happens if a client cancels?",
    description:
      "Your 5% residual simply stops when the account does — there are no clawbacks, except on refunds inside the first 60 days.",
  },
  {
    title: "Is there a cap on how much I can earn?",
    description:
      "None. The more active facilities you refer, the larger your recurring income — and it stacks every year they stay.",
